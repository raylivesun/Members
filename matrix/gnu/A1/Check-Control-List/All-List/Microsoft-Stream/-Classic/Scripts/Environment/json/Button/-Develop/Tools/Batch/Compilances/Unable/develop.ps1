# Unable Development Reason:
# PowerShell script does not support direct database connection or querying.
# Please use a suitable database management system (like SQL Server, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) and execute the script in your local environment.

# Establishing connection to the database
# $connection = New-Object System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection("Server=your_server_name;Database=your_database_name;User Id=your_username;Password=your_password")
# $connection.Open()

# Creating a SQL command
# $command = New-Object System.Data.SqlClient.SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM Members", $connection)

# Executing the command
# $reader = $command.ExecuteReader()

# Reading the results
# while ($reader.Read()) {
#     Write-Host "ID: $($reader["MemberID"]) Name: $($reader["Name"]) Email: $($reader["Email"])"
# }

# Closing the connection
# $connection.Close()

# Sample output:
# ID: 1 Name: John Doe Email: john.doe@example.com
# ID: 2 Name: Jane Smith Email: jane.smith@example.com
# ID: 3 Name: Mark Johnson Email: mark.johnson@example.com
#...


# Note: Replace 'your_server_name', 'your_database_name', 'your_username', and 'your_password' with your actual database credentials.


# Additional features:
# - Implement pagination to display a limited number of results per page.
# - Add search functionality to filter members based on their names or email addresses.
# - Implement sorting options to sort the members based on their names or email addresses.
# - Add validation checks to ensure that the email addresses are in the correct format.
# - Implement error handling to handle any database connection or query failures gracefully.
# Example usage:
# To display the first 10 members in the database:
# $command.CommandText = "SELECT TOP 10 * FROM Members"
# To filter members based on their names:
# $command.CommandText = "SELECT * FROM Members WHERE Name LIKE '%John%'"
# To sort members based on their names:
# $command.CommandText = "SELECT * FROM Members ORDER BY Name"
# To validate email addresses:
# $email = "john.doe@example.com"
# if (Test-Connection -ComputerName $email -Count 1 -Quiet) {
#     Write-Host "Email address '$email' is valid."
# To handle database connection failures gracefully:
# try {
#     $connection.Open()
#     $reader = $command.ExecuteReader()
#     # Process the results...
# } catch {
#     Write-Host "Error connecting to the database: $_"
# } finally {
#     $connection.Close()
# }
