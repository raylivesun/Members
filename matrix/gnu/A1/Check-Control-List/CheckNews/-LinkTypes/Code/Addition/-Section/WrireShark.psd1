# Wireshark is the tool for capturing and analyzing network traffic.
# Originally named Ethereal but changed in 2006, Wireshark is well
# established and respected among your peers. But you already knew that,
# or why would you invest your time and money in this book? What you're
# really here for is to delve into how Wireshark makes your job easier and
# your skills more effective.


# First, we need to install Wireshark. You can find the latest version
# here: https://www.wireshark.org/download.html

# Once you've downloaded and installed Wireshark, you can start
# capturing network traffic by running the following command:
#
# sudo wireshark

# Now, let's capture some network traffic. We'll use the 'tcpdump' tool
# to capture traffic on the network interface with the name 'eth0'.
# The '-i' flag specifies the interface, and '-s' flag sets the snap length
# (the number of bytes to capture).

# Note: Replace 'eth0' with the name of your network interface.
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -s 65535 -w capture.pcap

# After capturing some traffic, you can analyze it using Wireshark.
# Start Wireshark, and open the 'capture.pcap' file.

# In Wireshark, you can filter the captured traffic based on various criteria.
# For example, you can filter the traffic to display only packets from a specific
# IP address or port number. You can also analyze the packet headers and payloads
# to gain insights into the traffic.

# Once you've analyzed the traffic, you can export the filtered data to a
# different format, such as CSV or JSON, for further analysis or sharing.

# Wireshark provides various export options, such as saving the filtered
# data to a file or exporting it to a spreadsheet program. You can also
# use Wireshark's scripting capabilities to automate the export process.

# In conclusion, this book will guide you through the basics of using Wireshark
# to capture and analyze network traffic. By understanding the concepts and
# techniques covered in this book, you'll be well-prepared to work with Wireshark
# and improve your network security skills.


# If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to ask.
# Good luck with your Wireshark journey!

# Overview of the Book and Technology

# This book hopes to meet three goals:
# Broaden the information security professional's skillset through
# Wireshark.
# Provide learning resources, including labs and exercises, to apply
# what you learn.
# Demonstrate how Wireshark helps with real-life scenarios through
# Lua scripting.
# The book isn't only for reading; it's for doing. Any Wireshark book can
# show how wonderful Wireshark can be, but this book also gives you
# opportunities to practice the craft, hone your skills, and master the
# features Wireshark offers.
# These opportunities come in a few forms. First, to apply what's in the
# text, you will practice in labs. You build the lab environment early on the
# book and put it to use throughout the chapters that follow. The second
# opportunity for practice is at the end of each chapter, save the last Lua
# scripting chapter. The end-of-chapter exercises largely build on the labs
# to challenge you again, but with far less hand-holding. Between the labs
# and exercises, your time spent with Wireshark ensures time spent
# reading is not forgotten.
# The lab environment was created using containerization technology,
# resulting in a fairly lightweight virtual environment to be installed and
# run on your own system. The whole environment was designed
# specifically for you, the book reader, to practice the book's content.
# These labs were developed and are maintained by one of the authors,
# Jessey Bullock. The source code for the labs is available online. See
# Chapter 2 for specifics.
# In short, this book is a hands-on, practice-oriented Wireshark guide
# created for you, the information security professional. The exercises will
# help you to keep you advancing your Wireshark expertise long after the
# last page.

# Chapter 2, “Understanding Network Protocols,” is best for the professional
# with a strong understanding of network protocols. The main goal is to help
# you identify common network protocols, understand their structure, and
# analyze network traffic using Wireshark.
# 2. Understanding Network Protocols

# Network protocols are the rules that govern how data is transmitted and received
# between devices on a network. There are several common network protocols, such as
# TCP/IP, UDP, HTTP, DNS, and FTP. Some of the most commonly used network protocols
# include:
# TCP/IP: The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is a
# set of protocols that enable devices to communicate over a network, such as
# Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. TCP/IP provides reliable, ordered, and
# error-checked data transmission.
# UDP: The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless, unreliable, and
# packet-oriented protocol that enables devices to send and receive datagrams
# without establishing a connection. UDP provides a simple, efficient, and
# unreliable way to transmit data between devices.
# HTTP: The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless, request-response
# protocol that allows devices to communicate over a network using URLs and HTTP
# methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and HEAD. HTTP provides a simple,
# efficient, and flexible way to transfer data between devices.
# DNS: The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical, decentralized, and
# distributed naming system that allows devices to resolve domain names to IP
# addresses. DNS provides a simple, efficient, and reliable way to locate
# devices on a network.
# FTP: The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a file transfer protocol that allows
# devices to transfer files between devices using a client-server model. FTP
# To analyze network traffic using Wireshark, follow these steps:
# 1. Open Wireshark by double-clicking on the downloaded executable file.
# 2. Launch the capture window by clicking on the Capture button in the toolbar.
$path = "C:\Program Files\Wireshark\win64\bin\tshark.exe"

# Chapter 3, “The Fundamentals,” covers basic concepts and is divided into
# three parts: networking, information security, and packet analysis. The
# book assumes most readers might be familiar with at least one or two
# areas, but the chapter makes no assumptions.

# 3.1 Networking
# Networking is the process of connecting devices, such as computers, smartphones,
# and routers, to communicate and exchange data over a network. Networking
# technologies include Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. Some common networking
# concepts include:
# IP addresses: Unique identifiers assigned to devices on a network. IP addresses
# are used to identify devices and route packets between them.
# Subnets: Division of a network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks.
# Subnets help in organizing and managing network resources efficiently.
# 3.2 Information Security
# Information security is the protection of sensitive information, data, and
# networks from unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or destruction.
# Information security technologies include firewalls, intrusion detection systems,
# and encryption. Some common information security concepts include:
# Vulnerabilities: Weaknesses in a system or network that can be exploited by
# attackers.
# Risks: Potential threats or vulnerabilities that can lead to information
# security breaches.
# 3.3 Packet Analysis
# Packet analysis is the process of examining the data packets transmitted or
# received on a network to understand their structure, content, and behavior.
# Some common packet analysis techniques include:
# Wireshark: A free and open-source packet analyzer that allows network
# analysts to capture, analyze, and interpret network traffic.
# Network protocol analysis: Identifying and analyzing specific network
# protocols, such as TCP/IP, UDP, HTTP, DNS, and FTP.
# 3.4 Network Traffic Analysis
# Network traffic analysis is the process of identifying patterns, trends, and
# anomalies in network traffic to detect suspicious activities, optimize network
# performance, and make informed decisions. Some common network traffic analysis
# techniques include:
# Packet capture: Capturing and analyzing network traffic using software
# like Wireshark.
# Chapter 4, “Network Protocols,” covers various network protocols and their
# implementations. The chapter covers the following topics: TCP/IP, UDP, HTTP, DNS,
# and FTP.
# 4.1 TCP/IP
# TCP/IP is a set of protocols that enable devices to communicate over a
# network, such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. TCP/IP provides reliable,
# ordered, and error-checked data transmission. Some common TCP/IP concepts
# include:
# Connection-oriented: Data is transmitted in a sequence of packets, with each
# packet containing a header and a payload.
# Reliable: Data is transmitted with a minimum of one error-free packet and
# at least one packet acknowledged.
# Error-checking: A checksum is included in each packet to detect errors and
# ensure data integrity.
# 4.2 UDP
# UDP is a connectionless, unreliable, and packet-oriented protocol that allows
# devices to send and receive datagrams without establishing a connection.
# UDP provides a simple, efficient, and unreliable way to transmit data between
# devices. Some common UDP concepts include:
# Connectionless: Data is transmitted without a connection between devices.
# Unreliable: Data may be lost or duplicated during transmission.
# Packet-oriented: Data is transmitted in a sequence of packets, with each
# payload containing a header and data.
# 4.3 HTTP
# HTTP is a stateless, request-response protocol that allows devices to
# communicate over a network using URLs and HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT,
# DELETE, and HEAD. HTTP provides a simple, efficient, and flexible way to transfer
# data between devices. Some common HTTP concepts include:
# Stateless: Each request does not depend on the state of the previous request.
# 4.4 DNS
# DNS is a hierarchical, decentralized, and distributed naming system that allows
# devices to resolve domain names to IP addresses. DNS provides a simple,
# efficient, and reliable way to locate devices on a network. Some common DNS
# concepts include:
# Domain names: Human-readable names assigned to IP addresses.
# Hierarchical: Domain names are organized in a tree-like structure, with each
# level representing a subdomain.
# Decentralized: DNS servers are distributed across multiple locations,
# 4.5 FTP
# FTP is a file transfer protocol that allows devices to transfer files between
# devices using a client-server model. FTP To analyze network traffic using
# Wireshark, follow these steps:
